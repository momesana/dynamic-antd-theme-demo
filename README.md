See https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design-dark-theme/issues/8#issuecomment-807834949 and following comments
# How to build
Run the usual `npm install` followed by `npm run dev` commands. The dev server will use the port 3000
by default as defined in the webpack configuration (grep`webpack.config.js` for the variable `devPort`).

# How to switch themes
Simply select one of the preconfigured themes in the select, as shown in the screenshots below:

![dark compact theme](../assets/dark-compact.png?raw=true)

![light theme](../assets/light.png?raw=true)
